pub_style.py
============
Shared publication-quality matplotlib style, together with the small persistence layer used to keep expensive computations separate from plotting. Copy this file into the project and import from it rather than repeating rcParams in each script.

    from pub_style import apply_style, savefig_all, cm_both
    apply_style()

Every figure is written in three formats by `savefig_all`:

    .png   600 dpi raster, for web embedding
    .pdf   vector, for LaTeX inclusion
    .svg   vector, for web embedding and further editing

Mathematics is rendered through matplotlib's own mathtext engine with the Computer Modern font set rather than through an external LaTeX installation, which keeps the module portable to machines carrying no TeX distribution. Set `text.usetex` to True manually where full LaTeX macro support is required and available.

# Colour cycle
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# : House palette, ordered so that the earliest slots stay distinguishable both in normal vision and under deuteranopia, and so that faint colours appear late. A single-series plot therefore receives #009AFA, which is more decisive than matplotlib's muted default and clears the 3:1 contrast threshold a thin line on white requires. : : The order was chosen by measurement rather than taste: perceptual distance in CIE Lab, computed both normally and through a deuteranopia simulation, with colours below 3:1 contrast against white penalised. Two orderings mattered. Red (#FF0000) and olive (#AC8E18) are almost indistinguishable to a deuteranope at dE 2.2, so they are placed far apart. The three blues, two oranges and two cyans in the original list are likewise separated, since adjacent near-duplicates are what render a legend unreadable. : : Green occupies slot 2, immediately after red. Under simulated deuteranopia this reduces the worst-case separation among the leading entries: measured values are dE 170.5, 77.1, 46.1, 42.6 and 41.3 for two through six series respectively, falling to 22.9 at seven series, which is at the approximate collision threshold of 22. The ordering therefore remains workable through six series, but a figure whose argument depends on distinguishing two particular curves should carry markers or dash patterns rather than relying on hue alone.
#: Grid lines on every axis. Set to True to restore them; nothing else needs changing, since the line style, colour and width below continue to describe how they are drawn. Ticks are unaffected either way: the major and minor tick marks are set separately and stay as they are.
